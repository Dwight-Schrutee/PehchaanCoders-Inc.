## View Deployment

The website deployment is visible [here](https://aqueous-cliffs-29467.herokuapp.com/).

## Test the website

Currently, the website is in its initial stages of development. In time, new screens and features will be made live. The existing deployment features the following:

1. Student, college, and AICTE login pages (None of the 3 pages right now have validation of input, so any login credentials will work. This is temporarily done for checking of further pages.)
2. The basic view of the student details page, arrived at after going to the student login page and logging in. It currently features 2 buttons, which allow for password change and details updation. The existing studnet details shall be displayed in the remailder of the page. This page is still under development, as is currently in its early stages.
3. On going to the college login page, and entering any credentials (These can be any creds for now. We'll add password based validation soon, in future development phases), a successfully logged in page is displayed. Here, a college can insert/update the details of 1 student, of multiple students via a CSV file, and also view the details of its current students and alumnii (Only the details associated with that college) by pressing the correct buttons. Of these 3, the 'insert new student details' option is currently functional, the remaining 2 are yet to be implemented.
4. For viewing the details of the college's students, we are in the process of creating an interface that allows for this viewing. This interface can be reached at by going to the 'view student details' option, as stated in the above point. Although the details are being added to the database, the viewing interface is under development right now.
5. The AICTE login page doesn't redirect to any page yet, this component is still under development.
